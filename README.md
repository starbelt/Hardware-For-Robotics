My job has been to assemble and configure the drone, which will be used in later parts of the project. I began by putting together the bottom of the drone. It consisted of attaching the bottom plates, arms for the propellers, and small pillars that would hold the top plate.

For the top of the drone, I needed to attach the camera and antenna mounts as well as the top plate. I also added the accessories to the arms, which raised it from the ground.The skeleton of the drone was now complete with these parts attached.

I began to add the components that needed to be soldered to the drone. First I screwed the motors on the arms. Separately, I soldered the capacitor and wires for the battery onto the bottom of the stack. Once they were attached, I placed them within the drone and soldered the motors on.

The next step was to attach the top of the stack in order to be able to start adding all the different components. I started with the transmitter by soldering the wires onto the top of the stack. I also attached the antenna to the mount and to the transmitter. Once the transmitter was complete, I began to solder on the wires for the receiver. The receiver also had an antenna I had to place on the mount.

The last component I soldered was the camera. I first attached it to the camera mount using screws and then I soldered the wires onto the stack.

To finish assembling the drone, I attached the propellers in their proper place and strapped on the battery. I also used some zip ties to make sure the wires would not be cut by the spinning propellers. There is an additional zip tie on the battery cable as well, so it is out of the way.

I detached the propellers for safety and began to set up the software for the flight controller. I configured the motors to spin the correct way, as well as settings for the transmitter and camera.
