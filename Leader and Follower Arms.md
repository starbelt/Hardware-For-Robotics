# Leader and Follower Arms

The next step of the project was to assemble the leader and follower arms. I began with the leader arm. The first step was to attach the xl330 frame onto the first motor, this frame will essentially hold the rest of the arm.
After that I wanted to attach the motor onto the base howver it came in two pieces and there is no direct way to connect them. I used doubled sided tape to hold the two pieces of the bases together.

Once the base of the leader arm was complete the next step was to attach the second xl330 motor. This connection would serve as the shoulder of the arm. After that I attached the shoulder to elbow piece to the second xl330.
The third xl330 was attached to the end of the shoulder to elbow extension. This motor serves as the elbow of the arm. I also went ahead and attached the elbow to wrist extension to the third xl330.

I attached the fourth xl330 motor to the elbow to wrist extension. Seperatly I had to assemble the fifth xl330 to the elbow to wrist connection. Then I attached the assembly to the fourth xl330. Once that was complte the arm now 
had a wrist.unfortunately I did not take a seperate photo from this to the next step.

The last part of the arm assemblyy was attaching the hannd. I began by attaching the static part to the sixth xl330 motor and then attaching both of them to the fifth xl330 motor. Once they were in place all I had to do 
was attache the moving part to the sixth xl330 motor and the initial assembly of the leader arm was complete.
