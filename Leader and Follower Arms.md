# Leader and Follower Arms

The next step of the project was to assemble the leader and follower arms. I began with the leader arm. The first step was to attach the xl330 frame onto the first motor, this frame will essentially hold the rest of the arm.
After that I wanted to attach the motor onto the base howver it came in two pieces and there is no direct way to connect them. I used doubled sided tape to hold the two pieces of the bases together.

Once the base of the leader arm was complete the next step was to attach the second xl330 motor. This connection would serve as the shoulder of the arm. After that I attached the shoulder to elbow piece to the second xl330.
The third xl330 was attached to the end of the shoulder to elbow extension. This motor serves as the elbow of the arm. I also went ahead and attached the elbow to wrist extension to the third xl330.

I attached the fourth xl330 motor to the elbow to wrist extension. Seperatly I had to assemble the fifth xl330 to the elbow to wrist connection. Then I attached the assembly to the fourth xl330. Once that was complte the arm now 
had a wrist.unfortunately I did not take a seperate photo from this to the next step.

The last part of the arm assemblyy was attaching the hannd. I began by attaching the static part to the sixth xl330 motor and then attaching both of them to the fifth xl330 motor. Once they were in place all I had to do 
was attache the moving part to the sixth xl330 motor and the initial assembly of the leader arm was complete.

Once the leader arm was complete I daisy chained the motors together. Each motor has two plugs for cables. They are identical so what is important is connectiong them in a way that will allow the most motion for the arm.

The assembly of the follower arm was nearly identical to the leader arm. I started with a xl430 motor and attached it to the shoulder rotation piece. I then added the second xl430 motor to the shoulder rotation piece. With both motors attached I then added the base of the follower arm. I also attached the shoulder to elbow connection to the second xl430 motor.

I attached the first xl330 to the shoulder to elbow connection. From this step in everything is essentially the same as the leader arm. I attached the elbow to wrist extension to the first xl330 and the second xl330 to the elbow to wrist extention.

Seperatly I attached the fourth xl330 to the elbow to wrist extension and added the two pieces to the third xl330.I then attahced the static and moving pieces to the fourth xl330. The hand of the follower arm was complete and the initial assembly of the follower arm was as well.

The last thing I had to do was daisy chain the motors together similar to how I did with the leader arm. The only difference was that I did not attach the xl330 to the xl430.
