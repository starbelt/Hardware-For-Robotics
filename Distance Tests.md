# Distance Tests

AN important piece of infortmation is the range within the drone can produce a clear image to the goggles. I performed a set of distance tests at different power values to determine the maximum distance the drone can 
go while still producing a clear image.
<br><br>

During the first test, the drone was configured to use 400mw for the video transmitter. I placed the drone outside and connected the goggles to it. I took a note of my starting position via google maps and began to walk 
away. whenever I noticed a significant change in the video quality I took a photo of both the video output and my current position. Afterwards I went back and made an estimate of the distance to the drone at the time of
each picture.For the 400mw setting the video transmitter seemed to have a maximum range of 290 meters.

For the second test it was a very similar set up. First i changed the power value for the video tranmsitter to 800mw. I also changed the location, this time I perfomred the test in a parking lot. I set the drone down and 
began to walk away. Although initially there were some problems with the colors of the image as soon I stopped walking, the image would stabalize. I was able to walk across the entire parking lot while still recieving a 
clear image from the drone. I measured the distance with the same process as the first test and concluded the distance was around 275 meters. I will have to redo the 800mw test at a new location to test the limit of the 
800mw range.
